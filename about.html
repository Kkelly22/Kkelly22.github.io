<p>I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics, Minor in Philosophy, from Saint Joseph's University in 2013.  During my undergrad, I heavily focused on the art of logic by studying Mathematics and Philosophical logic simultaneously.  This love of logic prompted me to submerse myself in the world of programming, and I graduated from The Flatiron's Full Stack Web Development program in 2019.  Since then, I've been soaking up the tech universe one day at a time.</p>
