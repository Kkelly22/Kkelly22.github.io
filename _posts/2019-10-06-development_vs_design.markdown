For some time now I've been slowly but steadily developing my Wedding Itinerary application to keep current on the skills I've learned through the Flatiron School.  I've nailed down the CRUD capabilities, developed automatic sign-up emails, and even added a shareable log-in code.  Throughout this process, there has been one thing I cannot seem to get right, and that is the look and feel of my application.  This difficulty took me by surprise, because on a personal level I love to design spaces.  I am constantly enhancing spaces at home until I feel the illustrious 'coziness' wash over me.  This is simply not the case when it comes to the user experience of my application.  What is the takeaway?  Struggling with this is okay.  Why?  Because I am a developer, not a designer.  And just like development, it's going to take time and effort learning how to develop a good design.  

In my opinion, the fact that I was able to identify when a user experience is lacking is a good sign.  I acknowledged my observation and took to Google.  I Googled "how to enhance look of CSS" and quickly found a [blog](https://24ways.org/2012/how-to-make-your-site-look-half-decent/) that echoed my sentiments.  Although there are many key takeaways from this blog, there are two resources that will no doubt make my website 10x better in about 5 minutes.

1.  Font Pairing.  This is something I attempted to tackle myself, but [this resource](https://designshack.net/articles/css/10-great-google-font-combinations-you-can-copy/) does an even better job for you. 
2.  Texture.  This is something I could innately feel my application was lacking, but I didn't know how to go about adding it until I found [this resource](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/).

I hope this quick read helps anyone experiencing the same thing!
