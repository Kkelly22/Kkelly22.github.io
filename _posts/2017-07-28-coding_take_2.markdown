I ran far away from programming when I was first exposed to it.  I was a sophomore in college, piled high with work from recently changing my major to math, and had a pre-conceived notion that coding was really hard.  I got through the course with no intentions of doing *that* again.  Quite frankly, I didn't want to expose myself to something I wasn't good at, even though I thought highly of the capability itself.

Fast forward a couple of years out of college, a nearby job opportunity came across my LinkedIn.  A programming job that required absolutely no experience, and a willingness to learn the language from the ground up.  I applied on a whim, and have been there almost two years since.  

What have I learned since then?  A programming lanuage.  What have I gained?  The mindset that I am infact capable of learning this material.  Since this realization, my mind has been racing - is it too late to keep learning?  What other languages should I learn?  How do I go about learning everything I need to know?  The list goes on.  Incomes the Flatiron School, and everyday since I have learned something new and interesting.
