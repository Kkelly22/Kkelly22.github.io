HTML, or "Hypertext Markup Lanuage", can be thought of as the foundation of everything we see on the internet.  HTML5 is the current version of HTML being used that is accepted by the W3C, or World Wide Web Consortium.  

As far as I understand, each word we see on a webpage is being presented through an HTML tag.  Want to make a paragraph appear on the page? Put the paragraph between a tag named "p".  Want to make a header appear on the page? Put the header between a tag named "h".  Of course, HTML has vast functionality past the example above.  That being said, I did not realize until recently how intuitive the building blocks of a webpage are.

 *<p> Your paragraph here </p>
 <h> Your header here </h>*

In my opinion, the most important aspect of HTML is not the content itself, but how the content is organized.  The structure of HTML content must be organized in a way that is not only easy for a reader to interpet, but accessible for communication with other languages.  A webpage does not end at HTML.  HTML interacts with CSS (a styling language) and any open source language that adds user experience (i.e. button clicks, drop down menus, etc).

For this reason, I am striving to create clear cut content from the building blocks up.  I think this goal starts with planning out the project design before the code is written.  My content should be easily digestable, attractive, and must grow with future modifications.
