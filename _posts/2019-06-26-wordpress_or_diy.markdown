I graduated The Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development program in May of 2019.  Several months prior, my fiance had asked me to build him a website for a budding business venture of his.  At the time of his request, I hadn't completed the JavaScript, React, or Redux curriculum, and I was unsure if my skills at the time were enough to build out an impressive front-end in the time he needed.  I reached out to my slack community and landed on WordPress after some deliberation.  Did I know how to build out a fully function MVC architected website at time I came to this conclusion?  Yes.  Did I choose a platform that requires no such full stack knowledge in order to build my site? Also yes.  However confusing that may be, I've learned several valuable lessons from the choice I made.

First, WordPress is a tool in our programming toolbox and should be utilized if the circumstances warrant it.  In my particular circumstance, I was looking at a very cookie-cutter blogging layout with a tight schedule and even tighter turnaround time.  WordPress gave me the option to jumpstart a fully customized website in about 1 days time, and this benefited my 'client'.  While I certainly do not aim to fall back on the impressive WordPress arsenal every time I need to web develop, there is a delicate balance of sharpening your skills while not re-inventing the wheel on someone else's time.

Second, using WordPress actually reinforced my understanding of CSS and HTML principles, which is something that surprised me.  I had interacted with WordPress minimally before my education at Flatiron, and while it seemed user friendly I didn't *actually* know what I was doing.  Post Flatiron, developing on the WordPress platform allowed me to visualize containers, paddings, and margins in a way I hadn't previously thought of.  I was easily able to correlate choosing an element via WordPress with manually typing out an HTML tag element.  Clicking on an element's user-friendly 'paint brush' in WordPress was the same as me manually connecting each HTML tag to a CSS selector.  By the time I was finished designing a website in WordPress, I felt my Full Stack skills enhance.  Even though I did not choose to re-invent the wheel I still learned something new.  This brings me to my final point.

Developing is developing, no matter the technology.  There will always be more than one solution to a given problem, and choosing the most efficient solution is a skill set in and of itself.  And most importantly, there is *always* something to learn no matter which path you choose.
